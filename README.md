# QsimX-Modular-Quantum-Dynamic-Simulation-Engine
A modular engine for simulating non-relativistic quantum systems using numerical Schrödinger solvers.
## What are we actually going to do? 
1. Particle in a box simulation.
2. A Quantum Harmonic Oscillator.
3. Gaussian Wave Packet + Potential Barrier(Tunelling)
