# WHY WE NEED A GRID? 
1). Continous Space must be approximated
  Real quantum Mechanics include continous X over a infinite space
  
2). Grid is purely a Geometric representation.

3). Grid points represent POSITIONS.

4). Uniform spacing is essential

5). Grid enables derivatives
  Grid makes differential equations solvable numerically.
  
6). Grid enables integration
  A continuous integral can be approximated on a spatial grid by a finite sum
  
7). Grid is shared by all physics components
