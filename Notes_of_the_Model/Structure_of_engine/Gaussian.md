# Why are we taking a Gaussian Wavepacket? 
1. We are considering the Gaussian Wavepacket, because it is often gives us the idea that a particle is localized particle.
2. Gaussian functions are smooth and differentiable → easy to compute derivatives for the Hamiltonian later
3. Parameter and Mathematical flexibility.
