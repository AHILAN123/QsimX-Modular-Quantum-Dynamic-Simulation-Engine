# PHYSICS FOUNDATIONS
## 1. What is a Wavefunction?
  So, A wavefunction basically stores all the information about a quantum system. 
  
  ## *WHAT IS A QUANTUM SYSTEM?*

  Probably a system that is made form quantum objects(Electrons,Protons,Neutrons etc.. )

  They follow the fact that they show both the characteristics of a wave as well as a particle,
  as found by De-Brogile, the formulations of the fact that light exhibits dual nature is also well incorporated by      these quantum particles. They also satisfy the equations that 
  
  (p = h/λ)

  --TO BE CONTINUED HALF WRITTEN -- 
  
  
  A system is quantum if: - 
  
  1). Its state cannot be described by classical variables alone

  2).Measurements are probabilistic

  3).Superposition exists

  4).The act of measurement matters

  5).Observables are operators, not numbers
